<h2>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
<h3>Porting my Text-Based Adventure Game from Python to C++</h3>

<h3>Enhancement 1 Narrative</h3>

    <p>
        This artifact was a text-based adventure game that served as the final project for 
        one of my first courses in my degree program here at SNHU, IT-140: Introduction to Scripting. 
        It is a game where you are shown a map of the town you spawned into and must collect all 
        available items before taking on the final monster in one of the areas on the map. If you 
        collect all six items before reaching the monster you win, but if you do not collect them all, 
        you are defeated. The game originally was written in Python, and the room and item pairs were 
        stored in a dictionary.
        I selected this artifact to demonstrate my ability to port a project from one language to 
        another. Python to C++ in this case. This helps to show my proficiency in both languages. 
        It also allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of the various data structures in both languages
         by knowing which C++ data structure made sense for this original Python project. 
         The dynamically updating display of the current room highlights my ability to implement 
         real-time updates to improve user experience. I improved this artifact by transitioning 
         to a more efficient data structure for C++, a map in this case, and including a dynamic 
         game map position which overall enhances the gameplay.
        I did meet my planned course outcomes for this enhancement. I showed that I can design
         and evaluate computing solutions by porting the game to a new language and choosing 
         appropriate data structures. I used innovative techniques and tools by implementing 
         dynamic updates to the game map position which displayed my software engineering skills.
          I highlighted my ability to deliver professional communications with the game map which 
          provides clear visual feedback to the user or player. I am on track with the expectations 
          I laid out for the course outcomes I will meet in my initial submission.
        Porting code from Python to C++ showed me how much I have learned from when I initially 
        took the course, IT-140, where I originally created this artifact. I have gained a deep
        understanding of both languages and their accompanying libraries. This project only 
        helped solidify that in my mind. It did not take me exceptionally long to determine that
         the map was the best C++ data structure for the job. It was the closest thing to Pythonâ€™s 
         dictionary that I could find. The update I provided to the real time player position showed
          me just how useful dynamic updates can be, no matter how simple they are. I faced some
           general debugging problems throughout this enhancement but worked step by step to debug
            each time I encountered a new problem.
