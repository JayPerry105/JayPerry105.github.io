<h2>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
<h3>Porting my Text-Based Adventure Game from Python to C++</h3>

<h3>Enhancement 1 Narrative</h3>
<div id="text-container" class="collapsible">
    <p style="max-width: 600px; line-height: 1.5;">
        This artifact was a text-based adventure game that served as the final project for 
        one of my first courses in my degree program here at SNHU, IT-140: Introduction to Scripting. 
        It is a game where you are shown a map of the town you spawned into and must collect all 
        available items before taking on the final monster in one of the areas on the map. If you 
        collect all six items before reaching the monster you win, but if you do not collect them all, 
        you are defeated. The game originally was written in Python, and the room and item pairs were 
        stored in a dictionary. <br><br>
        I selected this artifact to demonstrate my ability to port a project from one language to 
        another. Python to C++ in this case. This helps to show my proficiency in both languages. 
        It also allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of the various data structures in both languages
         by knowing which C++ data structure made sense for this original Python project. 
         The dynamically updating display of the current room highlights my ability to implement 
         real-time updates to improve user experience. I improved this artifact by transitioning 
         to a more efficient data structure for C++, a map in this case, and including a dynamic 
         game map position which overall enhances the gameplay. <br><br>
        I did meet my planned course outcomes for this enhancement. I showed that I can design
         and evaluate computing solutions by porting the game to a new language and choosing 
         appropriate data structures. I used innovative techniques and tools by implementing 
         dynamic updates to the game map position which displayed my software engineering skills.
          I highlighted my ability to deliver professional communications with the game map which 
          provides clear visual feedback to the user or player. I am on track with the expectations 
          I laid out for the course outcomes I will meet in my initial submission. <br><br>
        Porting code from Python to C++ showed me how much I have learned from when I initially 
        took the course, IT-140, where I originally created this artifact. I have gained a deep
        understanding of both languages and their accompanying libraries. This project only 
        helped solidify that in my mind. It did not take me exceptionally long to determine that
         the map was the best C++ data structure for the job. It was the closest thing to Python’s 
         dictionary that I could find. The update I provided to the real time player position showed
          me just how useful dynamic updates can be, no matter how simple they are. I faced some
           general debugging problems throughout this enhancement but worked step by step to debug
            each time I encountered a new problem.

<h3>Enhancement 2 Narrative</h3>
<div id="text-container" class="collapsible">
    <p style="max-width: 600px; line-height: 1.5;">
        This is another enhancement of my text-based adventure game from my IT-140 class here at SNHU.
        In the first enhancement, I ported the project from Python to C++. In this second enhancement,
        I implemented object-oriented programming to modularize and simplify the code. <br><br>
        This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it represents a significant
        enhancement over the original Python project. It demonstrates my ability to apply 
        object-oriented programming principles, choosing the correct data structures and optimizing 
        them, and improving overall code efficiency. Coupled with the first enhancement of the same
        project, these enhancements showed my skills in refactoring code from a scripting language,
        Python, to a statically typed compiled language, C++. In this enhancement, I wrote
        algorithms for string manipulation to help make sure the user inputs were processed
        properly and not case sensitive. This helped improve user experience and the overall
        error handling of the program. This transition to C++ allows for more efficient memory
        management and runtime speed as opposed to the original Python version. I also created a
        simple animation for defeating the “Elemental Beast”. It was implemented with time delays
        for a text-based animation. The new code structure which utilizes multiple .h and .cpp
        files for different classes follows software design best practices. <br><br>
        I did meet my expected course outcomes with this enhancement. I met “Design and
        evaluate computing solutions” by refactoring the game using algorithmic principles,
        picking the correct data structures, and implementing object-oriented programming
        principles to improve the modularity of the code. I actually feel that I met the 
        “Develop a security mindset” with this enhancement too by making sure my input handling
        was robust enough to properly enhance the user experience of the game. <br><br>
        When it comes to the actual process of enhancing this artifact, I learned quite a lot.
        I ran into various challenges as this was the first time I ported a project from one
        language to another. Given that Python has dynamic data handling, I had to mindful
        with porting everything to C++, specifically regarding type safety and memory management.
        Breaking up the project into multiple classes helped significantly with managing each portion
        of the project, along with the overall modularization of the code. I also faced some 
        challenges transitioning from a single file project to a multi-file structure when it came
         to managing the dependencies and inter-class interactions.
