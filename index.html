<h1>Jacob Perry - B.S. in Computer Science</h1>
<h3>2025 SNHU Graduate</h3>
<br><br>
<h2>Self Assessment</h2>
<div id="text-container0" class="collapsible">
    <p style="max-width: 600px; line-height: 1.5;">
        My name is Jacob Perry, and this is my ePortfolio after completing SNHU’s Computer Science 
        program. The Capstone course, CS499, in this program has been a great learning experience. 
        It has been the most open-ended course in the program. I thoroughly enjoyed the freedom I 
        was given to decide what I wanted to work on throughout this course. The goal of the course 
        was to complete 3 enhancements to prior projects, or even to create a new project that fit 
        certain criteria. The enhancements were to focus on the topics of Software Design and 
        Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. <br><br>
        Throughout my time in this program, I have gotten married, had a son, and have been working 
        full-time all the while. I believe my perseverance and time management throughout this degree 
        program shows that I am willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. My years spent 
        in the manufacturing world doing electrical work, working with engineering teams, and 
        collaborating with software developers, and now having a B.S. in Computer Science all comes 
        together to make me a very competent candidate for many types of work in the Computer Science 
        world. I have spent the entirety of my career collaborating in a team environment and 
        communicating with those above me to ensure all proper standards and needs are met. <br><br>
        I bundled the first two enhancements into one project by taking a text-based adventure game 
        I originally wrote in Python and first porting it over to C++ to meet the criteria for the 
        Software Design and Engineering portion. Once this was complete, I implemented proper data 
        structures and restructured the game with an object-oriented framework. With the project 
        originally being written in Python and using a dictionary, I had to figure out the best data 
        structure to encapsulate some of that data using C++. I decided that the ‘map’ data structure 
        in C++ was my best and most efficient solution. I designed one class for the game and one for 
        the player. This allowed me to follow OOP design principles to keep my project modularized 
        and easy to follow. These enhancements thoroughly demonstrated my knowledge pertaining to 
        data structures and algorithms and software design and engineering. I also implemented a 
        dynamically updating player position relative to the map, and even a simple animation for 
        winning. These enhancements were to meet the criteria for the Data Structures and Algorithms 
        portion of the capstone. <br><br>
        I decided to create a new project for the Database portion. I wanted to develop something that 
        would help me with my day-to-day activities at my job at the time of taking this course. 
        I created a license key database using Python, SQLite, and Tkinter. My goal for creating this 
        project was to eliminate the need to keep track of various software licenses that I issue out 
        to machines with pen and paper, which was the previous norm. Before beginning work on this 
        project, I consulted with my team members and supervisor to verify that this program had the 
        necessary components to be effective. This method for collaboration displays my ability to 
        collaborate effectively with team members to meet company standards. One large concern I had 
        when I decided to use SQLite was the fact that it is a local database. My solution to this 
        was to allow the user to back up their database to a csv file with the click of a button. 
        This allows for anyone else using this program to get ahold of that csv file and load it 
        into their database with another button click. This also highlights my ability to produce 
        innovative solutions for company problems while maintaining a security mindset. <br><br>
        Completing my coursework over the last 3 years and creating my ePortfolio has been 
        instrumental in determining and improving both my strengths and weaknesses and has played 
        a massive part in shaping my career aspirations. Throughout my degree program and this 
        Capstone, I have honed my technical skills and demonstrated my ability to efficiently 
        manage my time. The skills I have gained in software engineering, data structures and 
        algorithms, and database management have prepared me to enter the computer science field 
        with confidence. MY ePortfolio artifacts collectively highlight my well-rounded skillset 
        and readiness to take real-world challenges head on. This collectively makes me both an 
        employable candidate in the industry and a desirable one. <br><br>

    <p style="max-width: 600px; line-height: 1.5;">
        This artifact was a text-based adventure game that served as the final project for 
        one of my first courses in my degree program here at SNHU, IT-140: Introduction to Scripting. 
        It is a game where you are shown a map of the town you spawned into and must collect all 
        available items before taking on the final monster in one of the areas on the map. If you 
        collect all six items before reaching the monster you win, but if you do not collect them all, 
        you are defeated. The game originally was written in Python, and the room and item pairs were 
        stored in a dictionary. <br><br>
        I selected this artifact to demonstrate my ability to port a project from one language to 
        another. Python to C++ in this case. This helps to show my proficiency in both languages. 
        It also allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of the various data structures in both languages
         by knowing which C++ data structure made sense for this original Python project. 
         The dynamically updating display of the current room highlights my ability to implement 
         real-time updates to improve user experience. I improved this artifact by transitioning 
         to a more efficient data structure for C++, a map in this case, and including a dynamic 
         game map position which overall enhances the gameplay. <br><br>
        I did meet my planned course outcomes for this enhancement. I showed that I can design
         and evaluate computing solutions by porting the game to a new language and choosing 
         appropriate data structures. I used innovative techniques and tools by implementing 
         dynamic updates to the game map position which displayed my software engineering skills.
          I highlighted my ability to deliver professional communications with the game map which 
          provides clear visual feedback to the user or player. I am on track with the expectations 
          I laid out for the course outcomes I will meet in my initial submission. <br><br>
        Porting code from Python to C++ showed me how much I have learned from when I initially 
        took the course, IT-140, where I originally created this artifact. I have gained a deep
        understanding of both languages and their accompanying libraries. This project only 
        helped solidify that in my mind. It did not take me exceptionally long to determine that
         the map was the best C++ data structure for the job. It was the closest thing to Python’s 
         dictionary that I could find. The update I provided to the real time player position showed
          me just how useful dynamic updates can be, no matter how simple they are. I faced some
           general debugging problems throughout this enhancement but worked step by step to debug
            each time I encountered a new problem. <br><br>
        Course Outcomes met for this project: <br>
        #2 - Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications 
        that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
        #3 - Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles 
        and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the 
        trade-offs involved in design choices 
        #4 - Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in 
        computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and 
        accomplish industry-specific goals

    <p style="max-width: 600px; line-height: 1.5;">
        This is another enhancement of my text-based adventure game from my IT-140 class here at SNHU.
        In the first enhancement, I ported the project from Python to C++. In this second enhancement,
        I implemented object-oriented programming to modularize and simplify the code. <br><br>
        This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it represents a significant
        enhancement over the original Python project. It demonstrates my ability to apply 
        object-oriented programming principles, choosing the correct data structures and optimizing 
        them, and improving overall code efficiency. Coupled with the first enhancement of the same
        project, these enhancements showed my skills in refactoring code from a scripting language,
        Python, to a statically typed compiled language, C++. In this enhancement, I wrote
        algorithms for string manipulation to help make sure the user inputs were processed
        properly and not case sensitive. This helped improve user experience and the overall
        error handling of the program. This transition to C++ allows for more efficient memory
        management and runtime speed as opposed to the original Python version. I also created a
        simple animation for defeating the “Elemental Beast”. It was implemented with time delays
        for a text-based animation. The new code structure which utilizes multiple .h and .cpp
        files for different classes follows software design best practices. <br><br>
        I did meet my expected course outcomes with this enhancement. I met “Design and
        evaluate computing solutions” by refactoring the game using algorithmic principles,
        picking the correct data structures, and implementing object-oriented programming
        principles to improve the modularity of the code. I actually feel that I met the 
        “Develop a security mindset” with this enhancement too by making sure my input handling
        was robust enough to properly enhance the user experience of the game. <br><br>
        When it comes to the actual process of enhancing this artifact, I learned quite a lot.
        I ran into various challenges as this was the first time I ported a project from one
        language to another. Given that Python has dynamic data handling, I had to mindful
        with porting everything to C++, specifically regarding type safety and memory management.
        Breaking up the project into multiple classes helped significantly with managing each portion
        of the project, along with the overall modularization of the code. I also faced some 
        challenges transitioning from a single file project to a multi-file structure when it came
         to managing the dependencies and inter-class interactions. <br><br>
        Course Outcomes met for this project: <br>
        #3 - Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles 
        and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the 
        trade-offs involved in design choices 
        #5 - Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture 
        and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and 
        enhanced security of data and resources

<div id="text-container3" class="collapsible">
    <p style="max-width: 600px; line-height: 1.5;">
        Rather than enhancing an existing project from my degree program here at SNHU,
         I proposed creating a new application. The purpose of this application is to be
         functionally useful in my day-to-day operations at my current job. The application
         is a license key database for various types of software licenses that are issued
         to machines with unique machine IDs. Currently, records of issued licenses are kept
         solely in a paper binder. I wanted to figure out a way to modernize this process
         and have a better system for backups, which this application addresses. <br><br>
        This application fits perfectly into my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability
         to be innovative and adapt to meet the needs of a company. It also shows the initiative
         that I am willing to produce ideas to make certain workflows and data management more
         efficient. This project consists of backend code written in Python, a database created 
         using SQLite 3 and a frontend created with Tkinter. This project demonstrates my ability 
         to create a full stack application from start to finish. I focused on both user experience 
         and an appealing user interface when developing this application. I thought of all probable 
         use cases for this program and tailored the development around the prospective end user. <br><br>
        This project demonstrated my achievement of the following course outcomes. It showed that 
         I can design, develop, and deliver professional quality communications that are technically 
         sound. It showed my ability to design solutions that solve a problem using computer science 
         principles. It also highlighted my ability to develop using a security mindset given that 
         the data in the database is customer specific and must be kept in the proper hands and 
         safely backed up. This project demonstrated my ability to employ strategies for building 
        collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision 
        making in the field of Computer Science by gathering information and suggestions from my team 
        at work to make sure that this application had all the necessary features to make it usable, 
        efficient, and secure. I successfully developed what I set out to do in my Module One proposal 
         by setting up the SQLite database, developing the CRUD functionality, creating the GUI via 
         TKinter, and integrating it all with the backend Python code. While I was comfortable with 
         Python, it took some time for me to work out how to properly implement SQLite and Tkinter 
         as I had limited exposure to both prior to this project. <br><br>
        I have worked with Tkinter once before on a simple program. This was my first time working 
        hands on with SQLite. Throughout this process, I have learned much about integrating all 
        aspects of this code to work together. My biggest challenges with this code were achieving 
        the desired functionality for every item in the GUI. I had to make sure each button behaved 
        exactly as I had in mind. A specific example that comes to mind is the functionality of 
        the ‘Edit’ button. I wanted to make sure that when I hit that button, the existing fields 
        came up pre-populated with the existing information so the user would not have to re-renter 
        that data into the database. I had to most fun messing around with the UI making sure it 
        looked exactly as I had been picturing in my planning stages. <br><br>
        Course Outcomes met for this project: <br>
        #1 - Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to
        support organizational decision making in the field of computer science,
        #2 - Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications 
        that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
        #3 - Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles 
        and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the 
        trade-offs involved in design choices 
        #4 - Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in 
        computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and 
        accomplish industry-specific goals 
        #5 - Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture 
        and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and 
        enhanced security of data and resources
